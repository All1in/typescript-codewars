# TypeScript

TypeScript code needs to be transpiled (compiled) into plain JavaScript before it can be run in a browser or on a server. This process involves the TypeScript compiler analyzing the code and generating equivalent JavaScript code that can be executed. The generated JavaScript code is often more efficient and easier to optimize than the original TypeScript code, as it does not contain the type annotations and other additional syntax. In this way, TypeScript acts as a layer on top of JavaScript, adding additional features and capabilities that can be leveraged when needed, but which are ultimately compiled down to plain JavaScript for execution.
